## 🎯 About the Project

This is my personal playground on the internet. The goal:  
Create a nostalgic portfolio that reflects my love for digital side projects, pixel aesthetics, and handcrafted layouts.

Everything is coded from scratch – no templates, no builders.  
It’s not just a website, it’s a vibe. ✨
